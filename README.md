👉 [Blockchain Developer vs Software Developer: Key Differences](https://taikai.network/blog/blockchain-developer-vs-software-developer)

## 💡 Why I Found It Interesting
This article compares **Blockchain Developers** and **Software Developers**, focusing on differences in:

- 🛠️ Required skills & tools  
- 📚 Career paths & education  
- 💵 Salary expectations  

What caught my attention the most was the idea of **“Be Agile”** 🏃.  
In the blockchain world, **Agile practices are not optional — they are essential**.  

✅ Short sprints and flexibility  
✅ Continuous prototyping  
✅ Quick response to changes  

🚀 Since blockchain technology evolves so fast, being Agile is a **must-have mindset** for developers who want to succeed in this field.

It was interesting to read about the similar but slightly different skillset blockchain developers and software developers have. Something I didn't expect was JavaScript being a skill blockchain developers needed. I honestly didn't know what blockchain developers really did so this article was a good read! - **Ian Jiang**
